                <p>For this assignment, we worked on training ourselves to improve on using functions on 
                    JavaScript. The website that is being used is called Code Wars and here they give you 
                    different training situations that are called Kata. For this assignment I 
                    got 5 different kata that had to be solved. The first one is called N'th Power which is 
                    the one in the photo above. This consisted of using arrays and finding the Nth power of 
                    the element in the array. The second is called Invert Values which was about taking a 
                    set of numbers and returning the opposite value of each number. The third was called Get 
                    mean of the array which was about finding the average number in each set of arrays. The 
                    fourth was called Short Long Short and this was about rearranging strings given and putting 
                    the shorter string on the outsides and the longer string on the inside. The last one we 
                    had to do was called Remove First and Last Character and this consisted of removing the first 
                    and last character of a string. All of these were a challenge but they were interesting and 
                    helped to improve my skills.
