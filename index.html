            <p> Hello! Welcome to My Portfolio Website. This is the home/about me page that will give you an 
            introduction to my website and myself personally. On this website, there is a home/about page, 
            assignments page, and an experience page as show on the nav bar above. On the assignments page,

            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>Hello, my name is Joseph and in this section I'm going to talk a little about myself. 
            First I want to talk about my hobbies. My favourite sport is basketball and I play this sport 
            a lot. In grade 10, I was on the school team, which was a very nice experience. 
            I don't only like to play it, but enjoy watching it as well. I enjoy watching NBA games and 
            watching the players play, and I would say that one of my favourite players is Trae Young. 
            I personally don't have a main favourite, but I really like Trae Young’s playing style, as he 
            is a quick player who can shoot and dribble the ball very well. I also like to play a video 
            game called NBA 2K, which is a game that consists of basketball. I get to play online with 
            my friends which is fun. Basketball is not the only thing I like, as I love to listen to music 
            as well.

            <p>The main genre of music I listen to is rap music, but sometimes I listen to RnB. One 
            of my favourite rappers is Travis Scott just because of the energy he gives off. I like his 
            personality and how he sees life when it comes toward enjoying it. He always says that he hates 
            bystanders at his concert because he wants everybody up and dancing and enjoying their time properly. 
            This also goes for in general, in life when your at a party or a celebration, you shouldn't be standing 
            or sitting around, but intead up and enjoying it. I also like to watch shows and movies in my 
            free time. One of my favourite shows is called “The Fresh Prince of Belair”, which is a 
            really good series that I recommend watching. One of my favourite subjects to take in school 
            is math. In the future, I am hoping to get into a career in engineering, as it is a field 
            that interests me. This is a little about me, the things I enjoy doing, and what I aspire 
            to do in the future.
